## 📖 Description

**PetVision-AI** is an end-to-end Computer Vision project that demonstrates the complete lifecycle of a machine learning product. Moving beyond simple notebook experiments, this project takes a raw dataset and transforms it into a production-grade Windows application.

The core is a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on over 34,000 images, achieving **99% accuracy**. To ensure the application runs smoothly on standard laptops (without requiring a GPU), the model was optimized using **ONNX Runtime**, reducing memory usage and inference latency significantly.

The interface is built with a modern, dark-themed Tkinter GUI and packaged as a standalone executable using PyInstaller.

*The modern, dark-mode interface allows users to upload images and get instant predictions with confidence scores.*

## ✨ Key Features

* **High Precision:** Achieves **>99% confidence** on validation datasets.
* **Lightning Fast:** Optimized with **ONNX Runtime** for millisecond inference speeds on CPU.
* **Modern UI:** A clean, "Dark Mode" graphical interface built with Python's Tkinter.
* **Offline Capable:** Runs locally with no internet connection required; data privacy is ensured.
* **Portable:** Deployed as a single `.exe` file (Windows) requiring no Python installation.

## 📂 File & Folder Dictionary
### 1. Core Folders
**models/**: The storage location for the "brain" of the application. It contains the optimized .onnx model files.

**dist/**: Short for Distribution. This folder is generated by PyInstaller and contains the final standalone Windows application (.exe) and its dependencies.

**data/** (Local only): The source directory containing the raw training and validation datasets (34,000+ images).

### 2. Application Scripts
**app_onnx.py**: The primary GUI application. It features a modern dark-mode UI and uses ONNX Runtime for high-speed, offline pet classification.

**test_onnx.py**: A diagnostic script used to verify model integrity and ensure image preprocessing math remains consistent across platforms.

**app.py**: The legacy version of the application using the original PyTorch framework for inference.

### 3. DevOps & Training
**train_model.py**: The training engine. Contains the CNN architecture definition, data augmentation logic, and the training loop used to reach 99% accuracy.

**export_onnx.py**: A specialized utility that translates the PyTorch weights into the universal ONNX format for deployment.

**requirements.txt**: A standardized list of all Python libraries required to build or run the source code.

**app_icon.ico**: The visual asset used for branding the application window and the executable file icon.

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Implementation

This project was built in five distinct engineering stages:

### 1. Data Engineering
Processed a large dataset of 34,000+ images (Cats & Dogs).
* **Cleaning:** Removed corrupted files and non-image headers.
* **Balancing:** Ensured equal distribution of classes to prevent bias.
* **Transformation:** Resized inputs to 128x128 and normalized RGB values.

### 2. Model Architecture
Designed a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using **PyTorch**.
* **Layers:** 3 Convolutional blocks with ReLU activation and Max Pooling.
* **Classifier:** Fully connected layers with Dropout to prevent overfitting.
* **Training:** Trained for 20 epochs using the Adam optimizer.



### 3. Optimization (ONNX)
Converted the heavy PyTorch (`.pth`) model into the **ONNX** (Open Neural Network Exchange) format.
* **Result:** Removed the dependency on the 1GB+ PyTorch library for the final app.
* **Performance:** Solved precision mismatches by enforcing specific Float32 operations.

### 4. GUI Development
Built a user-friendly frontend using `tkinter`.
* **Design:** Custom styling for a professional "Software" look (Segoe UI fonts, dark palette).
* **Integration:** Connected the GUI directly to the ONNX inference engine.

### 5. Deployment
Packaged the entire environment using **PyInstaller**.
* Bundled dependencies and assets (icons, models) into a standalone executable.
* Configured relative paths to ensure stability across different Windows machines.
