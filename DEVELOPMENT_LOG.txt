PETVISION-AI: PROJECT DEVELOPMENT CHRONOLOGY
============================================

This document outlines the step-by-step process of how this project was 
conceived, developed, and deployed.

PHASE 1: ENVIRONMENT & DATA ARCHITECTURE
----------------------------------------
1. Initialize Project: Created the root directory 'cat_dog_classifier'.
2. Virtual Environment: Set up a Python venv to keep dependencies isolated.
3. Folder Creation (The First Step): Created the 'data/' directory.
   - Inside 'data/', created 'train/' and 'validation/'.
   - Inside each of those, created 'cats/' and 'dogs/' folders.
4. Data Population: Loaded 34,000+ images into these specific directories.

PHASE 2: THE BRAIN (MODEL DEVELOPMENT)
--------------------------------------
5. Scripting Logic: Wrote 'data_loader.py' to handle image transformations.
6. Architecture: Wrote 'model_builder.py' to define the CNN layers.
7. Training: Wrote and executed 'trainer.py' (or 'train_model.py').
   - Result: Saved the weights as 'cat_dog_model.pth'.

PHASE 3: OPTIMIZATION & REFACTORING
-----------------------------------
8. Conversion: Created 'export_onnx.py' to convert the PyTorch model.
   - Purpose: To remove the 1GB PyTorch dependency for the final app.
   - Output: Created 'models/cat_dog_model.onnx'.
9. Verification: Developed 'test_onnx.py' to ensure the optimized model 
   remained accurate (99%).

PHASE 4: USER INTERFACE (GUI)
-----------------------------
10. Frontend Design: Developed 'app_onnx.py'.
    - Implemented Dark Mode styling.
    - Added image preview functionality and confidence score bars.
11. Branding: Created 'app_icon.ico' to give the software a professional look.

PHASE 5: DEPLOYMENT & DOCUMENTATION
-----------------------------------
12. Clean up: Created '.gitignore' to prevent uploading the massive 'data/' 
    folder to GitHub.
13. Dependency Mapping: Generated 'requirements.txt' for other developers.
14. Packaging: Used PyInstaller to bundle everything into the 'dist/' folder.
    - Final Output: A standalone 'PetClassifierAI.exe'.
15. README: Finalized the documentation with Mermaid flowcharts and 
    file dictionaries.
