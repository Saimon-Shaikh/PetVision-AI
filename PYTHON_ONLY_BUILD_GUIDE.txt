PETVISION-AI: PURE PYTHON (PYTORCH) WORKFLOW
============================================

Use this guide if you want to run the application directly from the source code 
using PyTorch, without converting to ONNX or building an executable.

PREREQUISITES
-------------
1. Python 3.8 or newer installed.
2. A powerful CPU or NVIDIA GPU (Recommended for training).

STEP 1: INSTALL HEAVY DEPENDENCIES
----------------------------------
Since you are avoiding ONNX, you must install the full PyTorch library.
Run this command in your terminal:

    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
    pip install Pillow numpy

(Note: The standard 'requirements.txt' in this repo only contains lightweight 
libraries. For this workflow, you need the full PyTorch suite.)

STEP 2: PREPARE DATASET
-----------------------
Ensure your folders are set up exactly like this:
    data/
    ├── train/
    │   ├── cats/  (Put cat training images here)
    │   └── dogs/  (Put dog training images here)
    └── validation/
        ├── cats/  (Put cat testing images here)
        └── dogs/  (Put dog testing images here)


STEP 3: MAIN THE MODEL (PyTorch Format)
-------------
File: main.py
Command: python main.py
    - Acts as the central hub to launch the application. 
    - Automatically checks for required model files before starting. 
    - Initializes and runs the primary GUI.
    - Loads images from the 'data/' folder.
    - Trains the CNN for 10 epochs.
    - Saves the model as 'cat_dog_model.pth'.
Note: Use this file as the single start command to ensure all project components are loaded correctly.his process may take time depending on your hardware.

STEP 4: RUN THE APPLICATION
---------------------------
File: app.py (Legacy Version)
Command: python app.py
Action:
    - Opens the GUI.
    - Loads 'cat_dog_model.pth' directly using PyTorch.
    - Performs inference using the PyTorch engine.

-------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY OF DIFFERENCES
- ONNX Path: Faster, lightweight, requires 'export_onnx.py'.
- This Path: Slower, requires 'torch' installed, uses 'app.py'.
